Before I became a software developer, I was a game developer fortunate enough to work on a variety of games alongside some great teams. In particular I was an artist generating 3D models of game environments, vehicles and props.

After a few years doing this and with no prior knowledge of programming, I decided to pursue a career in software development and make a career change. It felt like I'd be starting from scratch but it soon became apparent that many of the skills and habits that were built over my game development career were directly transferrable into building a career in software development. After all, they are directly related to each other. But I was surprised at just how much I could use to help kickstart my new career.  

With that said, here is my top 5:

# 1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) üìù
The software development life cycle can be described as the various phases of software development. It can vary, but its usually something like:

1. Planning
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing
5. Maintenance

As games are just small, fun bundles of software, they typically follow the same SDLC as traditional software. Obvious, right?! But joining a project with experience of the SDLC phases has played a big part in me hitting the ground running and reducing the learning curve than perhaps otherwise.  

# 2. Never standing still üïô 
The games industry moves VERY fast. Possibly one of the most rapidly changing industries today. To keep up, game artists need to be on the ball and evaluate new techniques and technologies to see what can be added to their workflow to improve the quality of their art or make their pipeline more efficient.

While traditional software development techniques might not move as quickly, it certainly helps to be aware of the frameworks, libraries and best practices as they pop up. Creating proof of concepts, demo projects and "I think I might re-make my portfolio in this months flavour of tech stack" are fun ways of staying sharp and keeping up-to-date on the landscape.

# 3. Eye for detail üëÄ
As a 3D artist, I took 2D designs and turned them into game assets and tried to squeeze as much out of them as possible without affecting the performance.

Being able to work with designers to replicate a design is the most 1:1 transferrable skill I have brought with me. Having an understanding of what the designer is trying to achieve helps to carry a vision through and demonstrate cohesiveness across a product.

This leads nicely into my next point...

# 4. Design skills üíÖ
Either actively or passively, skills such as colour theory, shape language and use of space are developed as a game artist. As a full-stack software developer, I can find myself adding new features to projects that require adding UI elements. 

Having these design skills to draw from when working on UI has made my transition much easier, particularly as this aspect isn't typically covered in CS courses in Universities.

# 5. Teamwork ‚õπ
I know, I know. The "can work in a team or by myself" thing is such a clich√©, but it's something that I think really applies when making a change in jobs or career. 

Having experience of working on project deliverables with high pressure deadlines and consistently being able to swap between generating ideas as a team or solving solutions by yourself, is something that has not only helped my career transition, but also in University as I studied Computer Science/Cyber Security. 

## Conclusion
I wanted to write this post not just to document my personal development but because it's interesting to think about how many skills that are transferrable across careers. In my case, there isn't a huge gap between the two careers, but I think many skills built up in one career can still apply to another career in one way or another. It might just take some creativity! üòÉ
